# AA Git repository

Welcome to the repository of the course **"Analytics and Applications(AA)"**. We will use this space as the central point for sharing code, data and instructions with you over the course of this semester.

You should check this repo regularly to view and/or download newly released or updated files. If you have experience using git or if you want to learn how to work with a state-of-the-art version control system, you may wish to fork and regularly pull updates to the repository onto your local machine for convenience.
